What's this?
============

This is a Go library for 2D hex grids.
    
It should be especially suitable for implementing games played
on hex grids.
    
It contains:

  *  Basic types and operations on them:
    * Hex coordinates
    * Hex directions
    * Hex coordinate sets
  * A shadowcasting algorithm (for field-of-view)
  * Protobuf equivalents of the above types
  * A couple of searching algorithms:
    * BFS
    * DFS
    * A\*
